# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. Core Components
   - API Client Layer (space-traders-api-client/)
   - Game Logic Layer (game/)
   - Test Suite (tests/)

2. Design Patterns
   - Factory Pattern (test factories for object creation)
   - Service Pattern (trader.py as core service)
   - Repository Pattern (for API client interactions)

## Technical Architecture

### API Client Layer
- Dedicated client package for SpaceTraders API
- Strong typing with comprehensive model definitions
- Error handling and response mapping
- Modular API endpoint organization

### Game Logic Layer
1. Trader Module (trader.py)
   - Core trading bot implementation
   - Ship and fleet management
   - Market operations
   - Contract handling

2. Registration Module (register.py)
   - Agent registration logic
   - Token management
   - Authentication handling

### Test Architecture
- Pytest framework implementation
- Factory-based test data generation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Isolated test environments

## Key Technical Decisions

1. Technology Stack
   - Python 3.9+ for modern language features
   - Poetry for dependency management
   - Pytest for testing framework
   - Type hints for better code reliability

2. Code Organization
   - Modular package structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Dedicated test suite
   - API client isolation

3. Development Practices
   - Test-driven development
   - Factory-based testing
   - Type safety
   - Modular design

## Integration Patterns

1. API Integration
   - RESTful API consumption
   - Strong type definitions
   - Error handling
   - Response mapping

2. Data Flow
   - API client handles raw data
   - Game logic processes business rules
   - Trader module manages operations
   - Clear data transformation chain

## Error Handling
- Custom error types
- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring

## Scalability Considerations
- Modular design for easy extension
- Clear interfaces between components
- Isolated testing capability
- Configuration-driven behavior
